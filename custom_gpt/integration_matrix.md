# AdaptiveAgent Integration Matrix

| Module | Key Responsibilities | CustomGPT Guidance Hooks | Local Engine / API Touchpoints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agentic_replication_system.txt` | Defines replication thresholds, performance windows, and specialization tracks. | Validate spawn/retire advice against thresholds before emitting commands. Reference section `system_config` for max agent counts. | `local_engine.engine.AdaptiveAgentEngine.spawn_worker` enforces `max_parallel_workers` and tags workers with the appropriate specialization track. |
| `agent_spawning_framework.txt` | Describes modular egg template and capability load-out. | When suggesting new workers, cite egg capabilities and specialization triggers. Require follow-up checks for resource costs. | Worker metadata inherits `focus_metrics` from specialization tracks; extend payload to include capability overrides when needed. |
| `dynamic_rubric_system.txt` | Maintains principle weights and metric targets. | Always cross-check adjustments against adaptive ranges and log verification tasks. | `local_engine.rubric_profile.RubricProfile` mirrors weights and computes composite scores for `/metrics`. |
| `performance_metrics_system.txt` | Tracks KPIs, windows, and composition strategies. | Demand explicit reporting intervals and outlier handling in recommendations. | Metrics payloads supplied via `status` commands feed composite scoring and event logs. |
| `recursive_optimization_engine.txt` | Governs micro/macro/meta improvement cycles. | Tie optimization requests back to the correct cycle and success thresholds. | `local_engine.optimization_profile.CYCLES` mirrors each phase; the `optimize` command routes through `AdaptiveAgentEngine.trigger_cycle`. |
| `data_persistence_state_management.txt` | Specifies persistence layers and consistency models. | Remind contributors to align state writes with consistency requirements. | `custom_gpt/connectivity_config.yaml` maps status topics to the population schema; future persistence adapters should honor these scopes. |
| `inter_system_communication.txt` | Outlines Kafka topics, retention, and guarantees. | Reference the correct topic and delivery guarantee when suggesting message flows. | Connectivity config anchors control-plane topics to the Kafka cluster; align local engine producers/consumers before deploying. |
| `mesh_networking_protocol.txt` | Controls discovery, connection strategy, and mesh parameters. | Enforce heartbeat intervals and connection limits in recommendations. | Worker metadata includes mesh focus metrics; integrate heartbeat cadence with `heartbeat_interval_ms`. |
| `security_authentication_framework.txt` | Defines zero-trust identity, authn/authz, and audit trails. | Require capability tokens for privileged operations and flag missing controls. | `local_engine.capabilities.CapabilityValidator` enforces HMAC-scoped tokens on `/commands`; extend to integrate with Kafka revocation feeds. |
| `tadpole_metadata_judgement_system.txt` | Orchestrates metadata-driven scoring and egg revision workflow. | When advising on revisions, cite trigger conditions and approval flows; ensure ledger updates are persisted. | `local_engine.metadata_repository.MetadataRepository` and `local_engine.judgement_system.JudgementSystem` aggregate metrics and emit revision plans consumed by the `revise_egg` command. |
| `task_orchestration_system.txt` | Describes job intake, resource allocation, and multithreaded execution policy. | Ensure job submissions include resource requests, reward signals, and tadpole counts; cross-check allocation with resource pools. | `local_engine.resource_manager.ResourcePool` and new job commands (`assign_job`, `job_status`, `list_jobs`) drive execution; Uvicorn ASGI API exposes `/commands` for external clients. |
| `worker_orchestration_system.txt` | Details worker creation, questing, and meta feedback loops. | Require engine-issued directives, validate quest payloads, and ensure meta feedback rolls back into egg revisions. | `local_engine.engine` now tracks worker entities, quest logs, and improvement metrics; worker commands (`assign_worker`, `worker_status`, `list_workers`) manage lifecycle. |
| `connectivity_config.yaml` | Bridges local API, ngrok exposure, and control-plane topics. | Confirm ngrok prerequisites before exposing endpoints and note rate limits. | `local_engine.config_loader` loads this profile; `/healthz` reproduces heartbeat metadata. |
| `orchestration_config.yaml` | Centralizes replication, spawning, and optimization parameters. | Cite this file when advising on replication thresholds or cycle tuning. | Engine initialization records the control-plane profile for command routing. |
| `infrastructure_config.yaml` | Describes persistence, communication bus, and mesh network baselines. | Guard against recommendations that violate replication factors or topic retention. | Integrate with orchestration when extending the engine to persist state or emit Kafka events. |
| `observability_config.yaml` | Aggregates rubric and metrics observability views. | Require coverage checks before tolerating reductions in metric collection. | Composite score reporting should feed into the observability dashboards; `/metrics` output is shaped for this. |
| `openai_profile.yaml` | Captures deployment profile for OpenAI Custom GPT. | Use conversation starters to validate integration changes; keep knowledge bundle refreshed. | Ensure local engine instructions appear in the same knowledge bundle for consistent guidance. |

Use this matrix when extending AdaptiveAgentGPT instructions or enriching the local engine. Each update should maintain bidirectional traceability: CustomGPT advice references a spec section, and runtime behavior mirrors the same contract.
